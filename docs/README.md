# Ansible Docs

I'm just a guy trying to learn Ansible. I started using git to keep my control server up to date, and, well, one thing led to another.

That's besides the point. We're here now, let's make the best of things. 

Take a look at the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) guide to get up and running on a fresh system. 

Otherwise, feel free to review any of the reference material in these docs.

Take a look at the [playbooks](https://github.com/mfeuhrer/ansible/tree/main/playbooks) and modify to your own needs.
